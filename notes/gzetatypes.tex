\section{Global Zeta Types}

In general, we think of global zeta types some indexing set with each element corresponding to a local zeta type, usually the prime numbers. However, another approach is to think of a gobal zeta type as a local one, where the numbers are vectors of numbers. In the prime-number case, each dimension of the vector space corresponds to a prime. 

\begin{propdef}
  We define the set of zeta types over a vector space $V$, written $\Upsilon_V$, as the set of all functions from the natural numbers $\N$ to $V$. This set becomes a ring with the structure of addition and multiplication defined pointwisely (multiplication of vectors is the hadamard product). Further, we can equip the ring with a $\psi$-structure defined by $\psi^k(f) : n \mapsto f(kn)$, ie. compression of the numbers.
