\section{Zeta Types}

In general, we think of local zeta types as sequences of numbers. The global zeta types are local zeta types over some indexing set, usually the prime numbers. However, another approach is to think of a gobal zeta type as a local one, where the numbers are vectors of numbers. In the prime-number case, each dimension of the vector space corresponds to a prime. 

\begin{propdef}
  We define the set of zeta types over a vector space $V$, written $\Upsilon_V$, as the set of all functions from the natural numbers $\N$ to $V$. This set becomes a ring with the structure of addition and multiplication defined pointwisely (multiplication of vectors is the hadamard product). Further, we can equip the ring with a $\psi$-structure defined by $\psi^k(f) : n \mapsto f(kn)$, ie. compression of the numbers.
