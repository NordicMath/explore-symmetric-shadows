# Ideas for project

* Umbra that is the computation of generating function at a value. Standard umbra accessed via dual numbers?
* Focus on multiplicative functions
* Implement our theory of multiplicative functions
* Reformulate Weil conjectures
* Global SS projected onto Local SS. Study nebula for varieties
* SS where umbra is NOT a homomorphism
