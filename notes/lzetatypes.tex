\section{Local Zeta Types}
Some motivation...

\subsection{Local Zeta Types}
A local zeta type is essentially a sequence of numbers. Mathematics has many notions of what it means to be a number, however for our needs we essentially require a field-structure, which allows invertibility in both addition and multiplication. 

\begin{definition}
  A local zeta type (in $k$) is a sequence $a_i$ of elements in $k$ which ranges from $1$ onward to infinity. This sequence is referred to as the the point counts, or the $\psi$-shadows.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  The Bell-shadows are the Bell antiderivative (TODO: define) of the
